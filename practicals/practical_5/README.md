### What I learned

- How to model real-world processes using sequence diagram.
- How the system components interact with eachother to accomplish specific tasks. 
- Mainly the logic in flow design.
- How diagrams helps in building clear documentation before actual development. 

### Reflection 
This exercise helped me better visualize how a complex feature like booking can be broken down into simpler components. It taught me to think not only from a developer's perspective but also from a user and business logic point of view.
